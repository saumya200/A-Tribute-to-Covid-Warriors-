            In the midst of the prevalent COVID pandemic, the IMA said that 798 doctors died during the
            second wave across the country of which a maximum of 128 doctors lost their lives in Delhi,
            followed by Bihar at 115, as per ANI. As per the IMA, Uttar Pradesh lost 79 doctors.<br>
            States like Maharashtra and Kerala where the prevalence of the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 is 
            on a rise , also reported deaths of doctors in double digits.

            Pondicherry reported the lowest deaths of doctors by logging one death only. Hours after Prime 
            Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday praised doctors for going out of their way to extend help 
            to people ring the coronavirus pandemic, IMA President Dr JA Jayalal said that
            the PM has assured that doctors will be respected, protected and safeguarded.<br>
            A large number of factors must have contributed to the large number of deaths of doctors 
            across states, spread of Covid-19 infection in different states played a major role. States 
            and UTs like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, had reported a large number of daily 
            Coronavirus cases during the second wave which explains high Covid-19 related casualty 
            figures among doctors in these states. However, there were some notable exceptions including 
            Maharashtra which contributed the highest number of cases to the nationwide tally in the 
            initial days of the second wave but the number of deaths in Maharashtra was only 23. Karnataka 
            which faced an upsurge of Coronavirus during the fag end of second wave also reported only 9 
            Covid-19 related casualties among doctors.

            Many doctors share their experience of working tirelessly during the pandemic . During ,
            these covid times they worked day and night , for serving the covid patients , like a soldier
            who guards our country from enemies , saving millions of our lives. They worked very hard , 
            though they were not self-quarantined , but had a lot of fear about taking deadly virus with 
            them home . They had to even sacrifice spending time with their loved one's and were brave 
            enough to work hard for our country .  But still , in some parts of our country , the doctors 
            and the doctors's professionals were beaten abusively by the  covid patients due to some 
            shortage of supplies , collecting samples from the suspected covid patients and even higher 
            medication fees during the  covid times and this made many doctors emotional and hopeless 
            during those times .

            Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has  emphasised the need for vaccination to all 
            citizens of our country ,  mainly for the age group of 18 and above . He had
            supported and encouraged a lot of people to compulsorily take vaccines , so that to fight 
            against this corona virus . The vaccines called "Covaxin" and "Covishield" were the two
            most important vaccines which were supplied to our country , India . For this , the scientists 
            and doctors worked relentlessly hard to examine about the deadly virus and to develop any
            cure for it . At presently , these vaccines are being developed to produce immunities in our 
            bodies , so that it can fight against any further virus . 
            Hence , in rememberance of our brave doctors , who had been a backbone of our country , 
            during the covid times , we're celebrating this year's National Doctors' Day (July 1)
            in remembrance of the veteran Dr BC Roy. We're so much  pleased that PM Modi greeted the
            medical fraternity for the Doctors' Day," the IMA President had said.
